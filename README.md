### Run The App

### Photos
The app picks photos randomly from the [`photoData`](https://github.com/diprefranco/random-me/blob/main/src/app/data/photo.data.ts) array. This array has all the information about the photos you want to show.
The photo files can be placed in the public folder inside the app, or in any other public url. Just remember to set the `src` property correctly on every photo in the [`photoData`](https://github.com/diprefranco/random-me/blob/main/src/app/data/photo.data.ts) array.
The photo dates are specified in UTC format to ensure always displaying the same date regardless of the user's time zone.

### Personal Link Resources
Inside the `src/app/services` there are some services with personal link resources. Be sure to put your owns there.
