### Photos
The app picks photos randomly from the [`photoData`](https://github.com/diprefranco/random-me/blob/main/src/app/data/photo.data.ts) array. This array has all the information about the photos you want to show.<br />
The photo files can be placed in the `public` folder inside the app, or in any other public url. Just remember to set the `src` property correctly on every photo in the [`photoData`](https://github.com/diprefranco/random-me/blob/main/src/app/data/photo.data.ts) array.<br />
The photo dates are specified in UTC format to ensure always displaying the same date regardless of the user's time zone.

### Personal Link Resources
